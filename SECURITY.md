# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The project follows bleeding edge philosophy, thus only the latest version is supported with the exception for release candidates (i.e. tags which are marked with `rc` suffix).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In the most cases you can report (suspected) security vulnerabilities directly on github by using ["Security report" template](https://github.com/arcan1s/ahriman/issues/new?assignees=&labels=security&template=02-security-report.md&title=). However, if your report could lead to data leak or break the system we kindly ask you to contact [current maintainer](AUTHORS) directly by email.
