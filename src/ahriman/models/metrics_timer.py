    metrics implementation

    Attributes:
        start_time(float | None): timer start time in monotonic time

    Examples:
        This class implements simple timer which allows to measure the time elapsed of the function. Usually it should
        be used like::

            >>> with MetricsTimer() as timer:
            >>>     do_something()
            >>>     print("Time elapsed for first function: %f", timer.elapsed)
            >>>     do_something_different()
            >>>     print("Time elapsed for all functions: %f", timer.elapsed)
