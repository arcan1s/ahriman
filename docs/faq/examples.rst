Use cases
---------

There is a collection of some specific recipes which can be found in `the repository <https://github.com/arcan1s/ahriman/tree/master/recipes>`__.

Most of them can be run (``AHRIMAN_PASSWORD`` environment variable is required in the most setups) as simple as:

.. code-block:: shell

   AHRIMAN_PASSWORD=demo docker compose up

Note, however, they are just an examples of specific configuration for specific cases and they are never intended to be used as is in real environment.
